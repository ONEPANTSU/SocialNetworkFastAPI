ðŸ’» SocialNetworkFastAPI is a simple and efficient RESTful API built using FastAPI for a social networking application. It provides various features to enhance the user experience, including JWT authentication and registration. Users can easily sign up and log in to access the platform's functionalities.

One of the main features of this API is the ability to create, edit, delete, and view posts. Users can share their thoughts, experiences they want with others. Additionally, users can interact with posts by liking or disliking them. However, they can only perform these actions on other users' posts and not on their own.

To ensure a seamless experience for developers, SocialNetworkFastAPI also includes a UI documentation feature powered by Swagger. This documentation makes it easy to understand and explore the available endpoints, request formats, and response structures.

Overall, SocialNetworkFastAPI aims to provide a robust and user-friendly API solution for building social networking applications, enabling developers to focus on implementing the core features of their application without worrying about the complexities of authentication, post management, and user interactions.
